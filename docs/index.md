# Welcome to LogFortress

## What is LogFortress?

*LogFortress* is a simple tool meant to help you debug your Docker containers. It currently supports containers detection and can help you to access container's logs easily in a centralized place.

!!! WARNING
    *LogFortress* is not ready for production use yet. It currently does not include any security features (e.g password protection for Web UI...) as it is focused on helping you navigate and debug your development environment. If you need a production-grade tool, consider using *Portainer*.
    
    Be very careful when using it in a sensitive environment as it exposes a Web UI on port `2001`.

## How to use this tool?

You can use *LogFortress* as a CLI tool or as a Web Application. You can consult modalities in our [Installation Page](installation.md).
